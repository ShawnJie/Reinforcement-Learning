# Reinforcement-Learning
Trading strategy based on Q-learning in a simple simulated market

In this project, I design and implement a simple Q-learning system which learns to exploit the arbitrage in a pretty simple one-security
simulated market. It is trained on simulated data, generated by a general O-U process. Then I use the trained system to trade for 500,000 periods, plot cumulative P\L and estimate its annualized Sharpe ratio.
